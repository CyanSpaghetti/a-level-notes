# Primary Storage
## Primary Storage is the storage that is required in order for the computer to function.
## e.g: RAM, ROM, Registers, CPU Cache, etc.
## Ideally we would want a storage device that has quick access time and can store large amounts of data. However this would be very expensive.
## Therefore we have made storage devices using a formula: Access time $\frac{1}{\propto}$ Storage Space.

# Important Types:
- ### RAM:
    1. **Stands for Random Access Memory**
    2. Is used by programs and OS, is faster to access.
    3. Computer loads programms from Secondary Storage to the RAM in order to do fast computations on the data.
- ### ROM:
    1. **Stands for Read Only Memory**
    2. Has several types; EROM(Eraseable ROM)EPROM(Eraseable Programmable ROM)EEPROM(Electronically Eraseable Programmable ROM)
    3. Contains the BIOS for the computer, as well as the bootloader
- ### Cache:
    1. A CPU cache is a small amount of storage very close to the CPU that it can do calculations on.
    2. Cache can also be a small part of the Secondary Storage devices
- ### Register:
    1. **Registers are data buffers right next to the CPU** but can only hold a certain amount of bits (usually 64)
    2. A CPU usually has multiple registers
    3. The CPU can do operations directly on the information in it's registers
