# Hexadecimal

#### Has previously stated, computers only understand binary whereas humans only understand denary.
#### Hexadeimal is a Base-16 number system that allows us to understand and write down binary values without too much effort.
#### The Hexadecimal system has the following numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F.
#### The placevalue for each number is similar to how it is in binary. However as it is Base-16 we multiply it with 16:
#### $FF = 15*16^1 + 15*16^0 = 255$ 
#### The computer does not use Hexadecimal but represents binary in this form so that it is easier for us to understand.
#### Converting back from denary to hex is the same:
#### $61 \to 61-3*16^1 = 13 \to 3D$
