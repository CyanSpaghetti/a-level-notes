# Binary and Denary
#### Computers only understand 1s and 0s. The 1s are a 5V current through a wire in the computer whereas a 0 is a 1V-2V current in the wires.    
#### Denary is used by humans. **Denary stands for "Base 10"**. As we have 10 unique identifiers to represent numbers. (i.e 0-9)   
#### Computers use something called **Binary (Base 2)**: Where each number can either be a 1 or a 0.  
#### To represent large numbers with binary we can chain together multiple 1s and 0s, called **bits**.   
#### Each 1 or 0 is then given a value according to it's position:
$$ 2^7\quad2^6\quad2^5\quad2^4\quad2^3\quad2^2\quad2^1\quad2^0 $$
$$ 128\quad64 \quad32\quad16\quad8\quad4\quad2\quad1$$
#### If we have, for example the binary number $10010101$. It is equal to: 
$$ 1*2^7+0*2^6+0*2^5+1*2^4+0*2^3+1*2^2+0*2^1+1*2^0 = 149$$
#### This is how conversions between binary and denary are done! :D
