# Uncertainty
## Uncertainty just means "a range of error in a measurement because of the limits of the tool or user"
## Uncertainties are always added, and they multiply with the variables powers.
## There are three types of uncertainties:
## 1. Absolute:
> ## $\frac{\Delta a}{a}$
## 2. Fractional:
> ## $\frac{\Delta a}{a}$
## 3. Percentage:
> ## $\frac{\Delta a}{a}$
