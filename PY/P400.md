# Kinematics
## what is kinematics?
> ### Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the affects of forces on the object.
## Equations:
> - ## $\bar{a} = \frac{\bar{v}-\bar{u}}{t}$
    This equation can only be used when:     
> - ## $\bar{s} = \frac{\bar{v}+\bar{u}}{2}t$
    This equation can only be used when:     
> - ## $\bar{s} = \bar{u}t + \frac{1}{2} \bar{a} t^2$
    This equation can only be used when:     
> - ## $2\bar{a}\bar{s} = \bar{v}^2 - \bar{u}^2$
    This equation can only be used when:     
> - ## $\bar{v} = \bar{a}t + \bar{u}$
    This equation can only be used when:     
> #### where $a$ is acceleration, $v$ is final velocity, $u$ is inital velocity, $s$ is displacement and $t$ is time

### Displacement
> Displacement is defined as "the distance moved relative to starting point."
> It is one of the most used vector measurements in A level physics.
> Its SI unit is $m$, for *meter*.
### Time
> Time is definied as "the interval during which change occours."
> It is a scalar quantity.
> The SI unit is $s$, for *seconds*.
### Velocity
> Velocity is defined as "quickness of motion" or "displacement over time."  
> It has a unit of $ms^{-1}$
### Acceleration
> Acceleration is defined as "the rate of change of velocity."  
> Its SI unit is *$ms^{-2}$*
